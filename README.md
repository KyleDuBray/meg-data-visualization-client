# meg-data-visualization-client

---

Project for Database Management Systems focused on magnetoencephalography (MEG) storage and analysis with machine learning. It uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) for the front end and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) with [Express](https://expressjs.com/) for the backend. A [Python](https://www.python.org/) [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/?gclid=CjwKCAjwm8WZBhBUEiwA178UnLETcZbGxgKLh-Fn-rpOAs22cL3N7BtjNn31cNm9G7ym9_pUSbUWbxoCajUQAvD_BwE) API is used for the machine learning model.

## Getting Started

`cd` into both the [client](/client) and [server](/server) folders and run `npm i` in each directory to install all npm packages for both the client and server.

After all packages are installed, you can run `npm start` and `npm run dev` in the client and server, respectively, to run each locally.
